This project explores building Game Engine components with the focus being more towards the simulation aspect thereof.
Currently the physics component of GECO utilizes the collision detection of the qu3e physics library, With the intent to build and integrate its own custom collision system.

NOTE: This version of GECO requires VS22 to be in x86 when compiling
